# About Me

I am a Junior ISAT Major at James Madison University. I am an Air Force ROTC cadet working to be awarded a pilot training slot. I have many hobbies, my favorite among them flying (I have a pilot's license). I live in Harrisonburg with 6 other Air Force cadets. I am looking forward to this learning new things and solving problems this year with my team!
